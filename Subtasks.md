1. Project Setup
    1.1. Set up a virtual environment for your Python project.
    1.2. Install necessary Python libraries (psycopg2, SQLAlchemy, Flask/Django, etc.).
    1.3. Set up a Git repository to track your project’s progress.

2. Database Design
    2.1. Identify the key entities (e.g., Books, Authors, Users, BorrowingHistory).
    2.2. Define relationships between entities (e.g., one-to-many between Authors and Books, many-to-many between Users and Books through BorrowingHistory).
    2.3. Design the database schema using an ER diagram tool.
    2.4. Create the PostgreSQL database and tables based on the schema.
    2.5. Insert sample data into the tables for testing.

3. Database Interaction with Python
    3.1. Set up a connection between Python and the PostgreSQL database using psycopg2 or SQLAlchemy.
    3.2. Write Python functions to:
    3.2.1. Add, update, and delete books.
    3.2.2. Manage user accounts (create, update, delete).
    3.2.3. Track borrowing and returning of books.
    3.3. Implement error handling and data validation in the functions.

4. SQL Query Development
    4.1. Write SQL queries to:
    4.1.1. Search for books by title, author, or genre.
    4.1.2. Check book availability (number of copies available).
    4.1.3. Retrieve borrowing history for a user.
    4.1.4. Identify the most borrowed books.
    4.2. Integrate these queries into Python functions for reuse.

5. User Interaction & Automation
    5.1. Create a command-line interface (CLI) using Python’s argparse module or a simple text-based menu for user interaction.
    5.2. Implement functionalities for:
    5.2.1. User registration and login.
    5.2.2. Searching for and borrowing books.
    5.2.3. Returning books and checking borrowing history.
    5.3. Add logging to track user actions and errors.
